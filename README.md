Real-Time Object Detection, Distance Measurement & Voice-Based Assistance
📌 Overview

The Smart Assisted System (SAS) is an intelligent real-time vision system designed to detect objects, estimate their distance, and provide immediate voice feedback to users.

The system integrates computer vision (YOLO + OpenCV), distance-calculation algorithms, and a speech synthesis engine to create a complete smart-assistance experience.

🚀 Core Features
🔍 Real-Time Object Detection

Detects multiple objects simultaneously

Uses YOLO and OpenCV for high-speed inference

Displays bounding boxes and labels

📏 Distance Estimation

Calculates distance of each detected object from the camera

Works on focal-length and pixel-width formula

Real-time dynamic distance updates

🔊 Voice Assistance

Announces detected object + distance

Avoids repeating the same object multiple times

Non-intrusive, intelligent announcements

🧩 Modular & Maintainable Architecture

Clean folders and separate modules

Easy to upgrade or replace components

Production-friendly code structure
